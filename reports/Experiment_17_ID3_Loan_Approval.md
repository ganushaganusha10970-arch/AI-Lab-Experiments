## EXPERIMENT 17: ID3 Decision Tree for Loan Approval Classification

### AIM:
To implement automated loan eligibility assessment in banking using Python.

### QUESTION:

A bank receives loan applications from customers with different financial backgrounds. A decision-support system can analyse customer information, such as income, employment status, credit history and existing loans, to classify applications as approved or rejected.

Develop a Python program that implements the ID3 algorithm using a customer loan dataset.

The program should:

1. Create a dataset containing customer financial attributes.
2. Calculate entropy and information gain for each attribute.
3. Select the attribute with the highest information gain.
4. Construct a decision tree recursively.
5. Classify new loan applications using the generated decision tree.

### CODE:

```python
import math

import collections

data = [

    ["Good", "High", "Salaried", "No", "Approved"],

    ["Good", "High", "Self-employed", "No", "Approved"],

    ["Good", "Low", "Salaried", "No", "Approved"],

    ["Good", "Medium", "Self-employed", "Yes", "Approved"],

    ["Good", "Low", "Self-employed", "No", "Approved"],

    ["Poor", "High", "Salaried", "No", "Approved"],
