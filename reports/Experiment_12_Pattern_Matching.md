## EXPERIMENT 12: Pattern Matching in a Healthcare Symptom Assessment System

### AIM:
To implement rule-based healthcare support for preliminary symptom assessment.

### QUESTION:

A healthcare support system receives a patient's description of symptoms in natural language. The system must identify relevant symptom keywords and phrases, match them against predefined rules, and return suitable guidance or recommend professional assessment.

Develop a Python program that applies pattern matching to patient-reported symptoms and identifies predefined symptom patterns to generate relevant guidance.

### CODE:

```python
import re

# Healthcare symptom patterns

symptom_patterns = {

    "Emergency Warning Signs": [
        r"\bchest pain\b",
        r"\bdifficulty breathing\b",
        r"\bshortness of breath\b",
        r"\bface drooping\b",
        r"\bsudden weakness\b",
        r"\bsevere bleeding\b"
    ],

    "Respiratory Symptoms": [
        r"\bcough\b",
        r"\bsore throat\b",
        r"\brunny nose\b",
        r"\bfever\b"
    ],

    "Digestive Symptoms": [
        r"\bnausea\b",
        r"\bvomiting\b",
        r"\bstomach pain\b",
        r"\babdominal pain\b",
        r"\bdiarrhea\b"
    ],

    "Neurological or General Symptoms": [
        r"\bheadache\b",
        r"\bdizziness\b",
        r"\bfatigue\b",
        r"\bweakness\b"
    ]

}

# Guidance associated with matched patterns

guidance = {

    "Emergency Warning Signs":
        "Seek emergency medical care immediately. Do not delay care "
        "while using this system.",

    "Respiratory Symptoms":
        "Consider professional medical advice if symptoms persist, "
        "worsen, or are accompanied by breathing difficulty.",

    "Digestive Symptoms":
        "Maintain hydration if appropriate and seek medical advice "
        "for persistent or worsening symptoms.",

    "Neurological or General Symptoms":
        "Consider medical assessment if symptoms persist or worsen. "
        "Sudden weakness or other sudden neurological changes require "
        "emergency assessment."
